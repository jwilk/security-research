This repository documents security research of a *certain individual*.

Here, threshold for what is considered a security issue is intentionally very low.

Some security-related stuff is hosted separately:

  to enable `American fuzzy lop`_ instrumentation of Python code
* `detsan <https://github.com/jwilk/detsan>`_
  to find sources of non-determinism in C (or C++) programs
* `longutf8 <https://github.com/jwilk/longutf8>`_ —
  overlong UTF-8 sequence generator
* `traversal-archives <https://github.com/jwilk/traversal-archives>`_ —
  archive file samples for testing against directory traversal
