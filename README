This repository documents security research of a *certain individual*.

Here, threshold for what is considered a security issue is intentionally very low.

Some security-related stuff is hosted separately:

* python-afl_, which enables `American fuzzy lop`_ instrumentation of Python code
* longutf8_, an overlong UTF-8 sequence generator
* `archive file samples for testing against directory traversal`_
* `fuzzing goodies`_
* `TIOCSTI ioctl tester`_
* getenvy_, an LD_PRELOAD library to snoop on ``getenv()`` calls
* stopgp32_, a tool to brute-force 32-bit OpenPGP key IDs
