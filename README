This repository documents security research of a *certain individual*.

Here, threshold for what is considered a security issue is intentionally very low.

Some security-related stuff is hosted separately:

* python-afl_, which enables `American fuzzy lop`_ instrumentation of Python code
* longutf8_ — overlong UTF-8 sequence generator
* `archive file samples for testing against directory traversal`_
* `fuzzing goodies`_
* ttyjack_ — proof-of-concept tty hijacking
* getenvy_ — LD_PRELOAD library to snoop on ``getenv()`` calls
* stopgp32_ — tool to brute-force 32-bit OpenPGP key IDs
* `DocBook XSL MitM proxy`_
* git-landmine_ — tool to create local malicious git repos
* `demonstration that less(1) is not a helpful pager`_
* `URL/shell-script hybrid`_
