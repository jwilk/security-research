The `git-check-ref-format` man page says:

    4\. [Refnames] cannot have ASCII control characters
    (i.e. bytes whose values are lower than \\040, or \\177 DEL),
    space, tilde ~, caret ^, or colon : anywhere.

But on some terminals (at least Linux console, maybe others)
``CSI`` (U+009B) is equivalent to ``ESC [``.
